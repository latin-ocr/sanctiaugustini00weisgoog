LIFE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE 145

so iar as he was permitted to see it by the light of truth, and
those who read his works on divine subjects profit thereby.
But Ι believe that they were able to derive greater good from
him who heard· and saw him as he spoke in person in the
church‚ and especially those who knew well his manner oi life .
among men. For not only was he a “scribe instructed unto the
kingdom of heaven, which bringeth forth out of his treasure
things new and old,” and one oi those merchants who “when
he had found the pearl of great price, sold all that he had and
bought it,'’ but he was also one oi those of whom it is written:
“So speak ye and so do,” and of whom the Saviour said:
“Whosoever shall so do and teach rnen, the same shall be called
great in the kingdom oi heaven.’'

Now I eamestly ask your grace who read these words, you
who bless the Lord‚ that with me you give thanks to God
Almighty, who gave me understanding to desire and power
to bring these things to the knowledge oi men near and
far, of presentandos future time; and Ι ask that you pray
with me and ior me, that as by the grace of God I have lived
with this man, who is now dead, on terms oi intimate and

delightful friendship, with no bitter disagreement, ior almost
forty years, I may also continue to emulate and imitate him
in this world and may enjoy with him the promises of God
Almighty in the world to come. Amen.
