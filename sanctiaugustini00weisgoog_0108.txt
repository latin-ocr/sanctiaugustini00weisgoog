all day and toiling at night. He was a type oi the Church on
high, even as most glorious Mary, oi whom it is written that

’ she sat at the ieet of the [ord and listened intently to His
word; but when her sister who was cumbered about much
serving, complained because she received no help, she heard
the words: “Martha, Martha, Mary hath chosen that better
part which shall not be taken away irom her.''

For new buildings he never had anyr desire, avoiding the
entanglement oi his soul in these things, since he wished al-
ways to have it free from all temporal annoyance. Neverthe·
less he did not restrain those who desired or constructed them,
provided only they were not extravagant. Sometimes, when Ι
the money oi the church failed, he announced to the Christian
people that he had nothing to give to the poor. For the sake
oi captives and ol the many who were in need he even ordered
the holy vessels to be broken and melted down and to be dis-
tributed to the needy. I would not have mentioned this un·
less I knew that it was done contrary to the carnal judgment
oi some. Ambrose, oi venerable memory, also said and wrote
that in such extremities it should be done without any hesi-
tancy. Sometimes too when the treasury and also the consis-
tory, from which were supplied the things necessary ior the
altar, had been neglected by the faithful, Augustine would
speak oi it in the uhurch and remind the people, even as he
once told us the blessed Ambrose had dealt with the subject
iu the church when he was there.
