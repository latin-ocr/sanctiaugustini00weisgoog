ters who were likewise serving God, although the councils oi
holy bishops placed these persons among the exceptions. He
used to say that although no evil suspicion could arise from
the fact that his sister and nieces were living with him, yet
since they could nothe without servants and other women
who would stay with them, and still others would come in
from without to visit tliem, because oi these a stumbling-block
or an occasion to fall might be placed in the way oi the weak.
He also said that because oi the presence oi all those women
who would live or come there, the men who happened to be
visiting the bishop or some one oi the clergy might either per·
ish by human temptation or surely be most shameiully maligned
hythe evil suspicions oi men. On this account, therefore, he
said that women ought never to live in the same house with
the servants ol God, even the most chaste, that no occasion to
fall, as has been said, nor a stumbling-bloek might be placed
in the way oi the weak by such an example. And ii perchance
a'ny women requested to see him or to salute him, they never
came in to him without some oi the clergy as witnesses, nor
did he ever spealc with them alone, not even ii the matter was
one oi secrecy. ’

CHAPTER XXVII ι

Service to the needy and sicle

In his visitations he adhered to the rule set forth hythe
Apostle and visited only the widows and orphans in their
afflictions. Yet whenever it happened that he was requested

hy the sick to come in person and pray to the Lord ior them
and lay his hand upon them, he went without delay. But the
monasteries oi women he visited only in extreme emergencies.
