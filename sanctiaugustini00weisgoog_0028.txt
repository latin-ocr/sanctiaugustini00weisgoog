raphy and which is best illustrated in the Lives of Suetonius.⁶¹
Possidius's acquaintance with this literary form evidently came
not directly from classical sources but through his knowledge
of the Lives ol former Christian biographers.⁶² Chiei among
these was undoubtedly Jerome‚ who aelmowledges his indebt·
edness to Suetonius.⁶⁸ This ¹form ol biography lays principal
stress on personal traits. Hence while Augustine's own writ-
ings are indispensable in forming an estimate ol his far-reach-
ing powers as a theologian, philosopher and preachen were it
not for the intimate revelations ol every-day lile presented by
Possidius, our picture oi his personality would be incomplete.
The date generally given lor the composition of the Vita is
432. From Possidius’s wordsit is clear that it must have
been written aiter July 431, when the siege of Hippo was
abandoned hythe Vandals, for he says he was in Hippo dur·
ing the whole time oi the siege.⁵⁴ Further·
more, his use of quondam in the same chapter ἐξ flu
(quondum Bonifocr'us) seems to presuppose ,Ι ,1,’,”γῆ2,
the death oi Bonilace, which occurred about
432. The terminus od quem is the destruction of Carthage in
439, ior Possidius states that when he wrote Carthage still
remained uncaptured.⁵⁵ *While the probabilities favor 432 or
soon aiter as the date ol the composition of the Vita, the evi-
dence for this is not complete and the nearest certain ap-
proximation attainable is 43²·439· No evidence derived from
the date of the buming ol Hipp0, which is unknown, or from
the presumed escape oi the church library irom the conflagra-
tiou can be deduced to help in fixing the date oi the Vita more
closely. The indiculus must, of course, have been made up

irom the books in the library at Hippo and might very prob-
