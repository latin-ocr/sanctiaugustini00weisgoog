CHAPTER XXII
Angustine’s use oi food and clothing

His garments and soor-wear and even his bedclothing were
modest yet sufficient-*neither too fine nor yet too meam ior
in such things men are wont either to display themselves
prondly or else to degrade themselves, in either case secking
not the things which are of Jesns Christ, bnt their own. But
'Angustiae as Ι have said, held a middle course, turning neither
to the right hand nor to the leit. His table was nugat and spar-
ing, though indeed with the herbs and lentils he also had meats
at times for the sake ol his guests or for some of the weaker
brethren ; buthe always had wine because he knew and taught,
as the Apostle says, that “every creature oi God is good and
nothing is to be rejected if it be received with thanksgiving,
ior it is sanctified through the Word of God and prayer.''
And as Augustine himself has set down in his books ol the
C onfessions, saying: “I iear not the uncleanness oi meat, but
the uncleanness of lust I know that N oah was permitted to
eat every kind of flesh which was useful ior food ; that Elijah
was reireshed by eating flesh; that John, who was gifted with
marvelous abstinence, was not defiled by the creatores, that
is the locusts, which became his food. I know also that Esau
was ensnared by his desire ior a pottage of lentils, and that
David rebuked himself for his longing after water, and that
our King was ¹tempted not with meat, but with bread. And so
likewise the people in the desert deserved to be condemned not

because they desired meat, but because in their desire ior ,·

lood they murmored against God.’' As regards the use oi
wine there is the injunction of the Apostle who wrote to Timo-
thy, saying: “Be no longer a drinker oi water, but use a
little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infinnities.”
