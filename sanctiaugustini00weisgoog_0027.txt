20 INTRODUCTION

ways mention the sources of his lew non-biblical quotations
but is apt to refer to the writers as cuiusdam sopimtir or
quium poeto.

Though he only partly realized Augustine’s true greatness
and his increasing importance to the Church, he did recognize
in him a devout Christian, a profound and eager student, a de-

voted aud watchlul shepherd, a mighty oppo-
ffls amem„ nent ol heretics and a daily example in his
ot Augurum domestic life He sees the present and lo·

cal greatness, but has less conception of the
lasting and widening influente which a· mind and personality
like Augustine's were destined to exer-t for ages to oome. He
sees that Augustine’s arguments and reasoning have established
the faith and brought peace to the Choreb, but that centuries
later theologiam and philosophers should still base many οἶ
their doctrines upon the writings of his friend is iar outside
the range of his imagination; for his nature, like his style, was
essentially prosaic. Yet he did believe that posterity ought not
to lorget Angustiae, and therefore wrote the Vita and corn-
pilcd the Incedunt a catalogue of Augustine's works, to

' κ help those who would keep his memory alive.

' The Vita, though not a regular chronological narrative, falls
· naturally into four parts:

’ I-V Introductory

VI-XVIII Activities against heresles

XIX-XXVII Daily life at home and in the church
XXVIII·XXXI Last days and death.

’ In this arrangement the Vita closely resembles the literary
form which had become traditional in the Alexandrian biog-

account of the war, and there is much in the statements of Victor and
Possidius to show the need ol caution iu accepting their laets as lit-
erally true” (L. R. Holme, The Extinction of Christian Churches in
North Africo, p. 88). This writer presents no evidence whatsoever to
sustain his disparagement ol Possidius, though he does so in the case
of Victor Vitensis, whose unrestrained statements must, oi course, be
accepted with reserve.
