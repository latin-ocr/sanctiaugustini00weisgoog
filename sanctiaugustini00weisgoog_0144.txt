LIFE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE 137

by love and both obey love. And it this argument cannot be
otherwise settled, so far as I can see, those who should remain
and those who should flee must be chosen by lot. For those
who shall say that they ought rather to flee will either seem to
be afraid because they are unwilling to endure the threaten·
ing danger, or presumptuous in that they judge themselves
more necessary to the Church to fulfill its services. Further- ,
more, peradventure those who are the better may choose to
lay down their lives for the brethren and those will be saved
by flight whose lile is less uselul by reason oi their inferior
ability in counsel and government. Nevertheless those who
are good and wise will oppose those who they see ought rather
to live and who yet choose to die rather than flee. Thus, as
it is written: ‘The lot causeth contentione to cease and parteth
between the mighty.’ For in difficulties of this sort God is
a better judge than men as to whether it is well to call the
more gilted to the reward of martyrdom and to spate the weak
ur whether to make thern stronger to endure the hardships and
to take them out oi this world whose lives cannot be of as
rnuch advantage to the Church as the lives of the others. The
procedure will indeed be rather unusual if the lot has to be
adopted; but it it has been used who shall presume to call it
into question? Who, except hehe ignorant or envious‚ will
not praise it with fitting commendationi But if this method
is not round satisfactory on the ground that no instance ol
such a procedure occurs, let no one by his ssight cause the
ministration of the Church, especially needful and due arnid
such great perils, to cease. Letno one regard his own person,
so that if he seem to excel in some grace, he should on this

account say he is more deserving ol life and therefore oi
flight. For whoever thinks this doubtless pleases himself3
but whoever also says this, displeases all.
