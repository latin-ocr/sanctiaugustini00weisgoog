“almost forty years.’' Augustine was made
Presbyter at Hippo in 391 and “soon after''²² established his
monastery. As this was thirty-uine years before Augustine's
death, Possidius must have become connected with the monas·
tery at the very beginning or soon after. Where he came
from and how he came to enter the monastery must remain
matters of conjecture, but it seems fair to suppose that he
came from Hippo or the immediate neighborhood.

The date of Possidius's birth, als0, may be arrived at only
approximately. As he was still living and performing his
episcopal duties seven years after the death of Augustine‚²³
who lived to be seventy-six,²⁴ he was in all likelihood younger
than his teacher and friend. When he entered the monastery,
therefore, he was probably not over thirty, as Augustine was
then thirty-five. Moreover he was probably at least twenty, in
view of the fact that he soon became Augustine’s intimate
friend. This would accordingly fix the date of his birth
somewhere between the years 360 and 370.

In 397, probably within a' short time after the death of
Megalius, Bishop of Calama and Primate of Numidia, Pos-
sidius succeeded to this episcopate, though not to the primacy,
as that was an office of seniority, not of locality, in the Afri-
can Church. From this time till his activities were tempor-
arily checked by the invasion of the Vandals, he seems to
have led a not unusual life for a North African bishop of the
fifth century, journeying to the various parts of his diocese,
attending councils and defending the Church against the at-
tacks of heretics.
