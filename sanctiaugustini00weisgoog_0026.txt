INTRODUCTION 19

He had seen him faithful in his secular responsibilities‚ yet
escaping thern whenever possible and eagerly turning his at·
tention to spiritual matters. He knew his habits of dress aod
food and had shared in his strict monastic asceticism. Later,
himself a bishop, Possidius had seen Augustine as a leader
among his fellow-bishops at the councils and as the Church’s
ablest defendet against heresies. He was constantly in touch
with his great master and friend and at no time throughout the
thirty-eight or thirty-nine years of their acquaintance did
anything occur to weaken their attachment. With the ex-
ception of the first four chapters of the V ito, which deal briefly
with the period before their acquaintance, the account he gives
is based entirely on his own observation-things he had him·
self witnessed and experienced.

As a result we have a plain biography of fact, not of fiction.
Possidius does not recount mere gossip or hearsay. Nowhere
throughout the Vita do phrases occur indicating second-hand
information. One thing that must immedi-
ately commend it as worthy of belief is the m,
absence of such miraculous tales as abound in Relatum
Paulinus's Vita Ambrosii. Even Augustine
was not free from this credulity, as may be seen in the list of
remarkable cures related toward the end of the De Civitote
Dei. Possidius, however, was not given to recounting mar-
velous stories. Apart nom a somewhat general reference to
“certain energumens” from whom “demons departed by reason
of Augustine’s intercession in prayer‚” he relates without af-
fectation or extravagance, only one specific miracle performed
by ‘Augustine-the cure of a sick man by the laying on of
hands. Moreover, wherever Possidius’s statements can be
checked by the writings of Augustine or the Acts of Councils,
they are always fully corroborated.⁴⁸ To this there is no ex-
ception.¹⁹ Yet in one respect he is careless: he does not al·
