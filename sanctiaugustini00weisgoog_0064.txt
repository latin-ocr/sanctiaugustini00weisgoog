LIFE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE 57

ter with the Bishop of Carthage, the episcopal Primate, men·
tioning the wealmess of his body and the burden of his years,
and beseeching that Augustino might be ordained bishop oi the
church ol Hippo, because he would not in that case then suc-
ceed to his office, but would be associated with him as coad-
jutor-bishop. And what he thus sought and desired he ob·
tained in a satisfactory answer. Later on, accordingly, when
Megalius, Bishop ol Calama, and at that time primate oi
Numidia, had come athis request to visit the church at Hippo,
unexpectedly to all the bishop Valerius made his desire lmown
to the bishops who happened at that time to be present, and
to all the clergy of Hippo and to all the people. But while all
who heard rejoiced and clamored most eugerly that tbis
should be done and accomplished, the presbyter refused to
accept the episcopate contrary to the custom of the Church,
since his bishop was still living. However, when they had con-
vinced him that this was generally done and had appealed to
examples from the churches across the sea as well as in
Africa, though he had been ignorant ol it before, under com-
pulsion and constraint he yielded and accepted the ordination
to the higher office. Later he both said and wrote that this
should not have been done in his case, namely to ordain him
while his bishop was still living, because ol the prohibition of
the Ecumenical Council of which he learned alter his ordi·
nati0n; for that which he regretted to have had done in his case
he did not wish to have done to others. Therelore he en-

deavored to have it decreed by the eouncils of the bishops
that the rules governing all the priests should be made lmown
by the ordaining bishops to those about to be ordained and
to those already ordained. And so it was done.
