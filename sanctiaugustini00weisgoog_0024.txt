the intimacy which existed between the two bishops. Among
Augustine’s letters there is only one⁴⁶ ad·

dressed to Possidius and that is merely an ffl, ham
answer to a question on discipline, such as virt Augurum
might have been written to any stranger who

had asked for advice. It was written in great haste and there
is nothing in it to indicate any particular friendship. How·
ever, he spent much time in company with Augustine. For the
first five or six years of their acquaintance he lived in that
intimacy of daily companionship which makes or breaks a
friendship as nothing else can, dwelling in the same house,
eating at the same table, sharing in the same §ludes and exg
periencing the same trials and temptations. On one occasion
he tells of a conversation at the table, then of a convert who
came to see Augrrstine and, nobis corono, declared his former
guilt and asked for their prayers. Again, we hear of Augus-
tine's righteous indignation when some friends who were visit·
ing disregarded his prohibition of gossip.⁴⁰ There are many
instances of this intimate nature.

After Possidius left the monastery at Hippo to take up his
duties as bishop of Calama he was by no means separated
from his friend. Calama was only about forty miles distant
from Hippo and the two bishops found many opportunities of
seeing ea‘eh other. Now they are attending the same council,
or are together on a special committee, or are side by side in a
debete with the heretics, or Possidius is visiting Augustine.
Finally, when Calama was taken by the Vandals, Possidius
withdrew to Hippo and was with Augustine all through his
last illness and at the time of his death. None of the other
members of that monastery, save Alypius only, is associated
with Augustine as frequently as is Possidius. s ἵ

Besides the above-mentioned letter addressed to Possidius
and those cited in this account oi Possidius’s life, there are
several other references to him in Augustine's writings Prob-
