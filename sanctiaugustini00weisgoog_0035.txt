28 INTRODUCTION

of saints did not receive the same consideration as those of
classical writers. Lives of saints were very common and were
freely multiplied. Scribes were less careful with them than
with either the Scriptures or classical writings for thch a
greater amount of regard was felt; for the former be
cause of their inspired nature and for the latter because of
their rarity and antiquity. Hence there was less restraint in
copying the texts of these Lives. Accordingly there are more
individual differences in such MSS. and the family groups
are not as clearly defined. Moreover since the MSS. of any
one Life are so much more numerous than for most classical
texts—in the present case probably two hundred or more-
definite relationship is clearly more difficult to establish on the
basis of only a part of the extant MSS. of a given Life.
Thus in the case of the ten MSS. of the Vita Augustini ex-
amined for this edition, each MS. is in some degree independent
of the others. Under such conditions, therefore, the choice of
the best MS. or group of MSS, may be made by a process of
elimination. In a comparison of the ten MSS. with a view to
this choice GHJK may be omitted as they are quite fragmen-
tary. Orthe other six MSS. the crucial readings of A andB
frequently agree in opposition to all the others, thus showing
a certain relationship between these two. For instance in the
t Praefatio ΑΒ read videor frendore, whereas CDFHK read
fraudare videam ΑΒ nutem, CDEFHK enim. In Chapter 1 Α
andB both read corthapinensi which is, of course, an error for
tagastensi. In this same chapter AB read assistens as against
astons in CDEFHJK. Other instantes of this agreement
between Α and B niay easily be found in the apparatus criticus.
C, on the other hand, contains many readings found in none
of the other nine MSS, except only in the corrections made ,
in D by a second hand. Thns in Chapter VIII for the reading
sed cmocerdos found in the other MSS. CD* have quom
consacerdos; in Chapter IX for Quae cum audissent . . .
comperta, CD* have quoe virbeatus comperto; at the end of
Chapter XV while the other MSS. vary between vivat, vivit
