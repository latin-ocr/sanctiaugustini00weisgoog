LIFE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE 59

CHAPTER IX
He contends with the Donatists

As bishop he preached the Word oi eternal salvation much
more earnestly and fervently and with'greater authority, no
longer in one district only, but wherever he went in answer to
requests, ready always to give an answer to every man that
asked of him a reason of the faith and hope which is toward
God. And the Church of the Lord flourished and grew rapidly
and strongly. The Donatists in particular, who lived in Hippo
and the neighboring towns, brought his addresses and writings
to their bishops. And ii, when they had heard these, they
perchance made any reply‚ they were either reiuted by their
own followers or else their replies were brought to the holy
Augustine; and when he had reviewed them patiently and
calmly (and, as it is written, he worked out the salvation of
men with fear and trembling, showing how they would and
could reiute nothing and how true and manifest is that doc-
trine which the Church oi God holds and has understood) ; on
these things he labored continually by day and by night. He
even wrote private letters to prominent bishops of this error
and to laymen, urging and exhorting them by the arguments
which he *offered that they should either abendon the error
or at least enter into a discussion with him. In their distrust
they were never willing even to answer him in writing, but
in anger spoke furiously, privately and publicly declaring that

'Augustino was a seducet and deceiver of souls. They said
and preached that the wolf must be killed in defence ol their
flock, and neither fearing God nor ashamed before men, they
taught the people to believe that whoever should be able to do
this would undoubtedly have all his sins forgiven oi God.
Meanwhile Augustine sought to make known to all their lack
