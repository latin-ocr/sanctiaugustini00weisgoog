LIFE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE 109

that Ambrose added this second saying-“I do not lear to die,
lor we have a Lord who is good'’-so that no one might be·
lieve that from overconfidence in thepurity oi his own lile he
had first said, “I have not so lived that I should be ashamed
to live among you.'' Now this he had said in reference to that
which men ean judge about a iellow-man; but as' ior his
judgment by the divine iustice, he trusted rather in the Lord ’
who is good to whom he also said in the daily prayer: “For-
give us our trespasses.”

Moreover toward the end ol his lite Augustine very fre·
quently repeated in this same connection the words of a cer· ,
tain lellow-bishop and very intimate friend. For when he had
gone to visit him several times as he drew near to death and
he had indicated by a gesture oi his hand that he was soon to
depart from this world, Augustine had said to him that he
might still be oi great benefit to the Church ii he lived. But
that no one should think he was captivated by a desire
lor this life he had answered: “If I were never to die it
would he well ; but if Ι am ever to die, why not now ?’' This
sentiment was much admired by Augustino and he praised him
who had given voice to it7-a man who ieared God, indeed,
but who had been born and brought up in a small town and
was not much educated in the art of reading. Compare on the
other hand the attitude of a certain ailing hishop ol whom the
holy martyr Cyprian speaks on this wise in his letter which he
wrote on Mortality, saying: “When a certain one of our col-
leagues and iellowpriests, wearied with infirmity and troubled
at the near approach ol death, prayed for an extension of his
lile, there stood by him as he prayed and was even now on the
point of death, a youth, venerable in glory and majesty, tall of
stature and with radiant countenance. And mortal eyes could
scarcely have endured to look upon himas he stood there,
