LIFE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE

the divine Majesty that by His aid I may carry out and com-
plete this task, which I have undertaken, without sinning
against the truth of the Father of Lights or seerning in any
way to disappoint the loving expectation of good sons of the
Church. Itis not my purpose to touch on all those things
which the blessed Augustine noted about himself in his books
of the confessione, telling what his lile was before receiving
the divine grace and what il became on his conversion. For it
was his purpose that, in the words of the Apostle, “no man
should believe or think him to be above that which he knew
him to be or heard of him.'' Therefore in his practice ol holy
humility ‘he deceived no one and sought not his own praise for
those things he had already received, but the glory of his
Lord because of the blessing of his own deliverance, and de·
sired the prayers of his brethren for the things which he
hoped to obtain. For, as declared by the angel, though “It is

good to hide the secret of a king: yet it is honorable to reveal
and confess the works of God.’'

. CHAPTER I

Augustine's birth, conversion and baptism

Augustine was born in the African province, in the city of
Tagaste oi honorable Christian parents of curial rank and
was nurtured and trained under their care and attention. At
- their expense he was educated chiefly in secular literature,
that is, was trained in all the disciplines which are called liberal.
For he first taught grammar in his own town and then rhetoric

, at Carthage‚ the capitol of Africa. Subsequently [he taught]

across the sea in the city of Rome and at Milan where the Em· Α
peror Valentinian the Younger had then established his court.
