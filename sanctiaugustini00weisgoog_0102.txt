LIFE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE 95

His spoons only were suver, but the vessels in which food was
served were earthen, wooden or marble: yet this was not from
the compulsion of necessity, but from the choice of his own
will. He always showed hospitality. At the table he loved
reading and discussion rather than eating and drinking, and
against that pest oi human custom he had this inscription on
his table: ’
Who injures the name of an absent friend

May not at this table as guest attend.
Thus he warned every guest to refrain from unnecessary and
harmful tales. And when some of his most intimate fellow-
bishops iorgot that inscription and spoke without heeding it,
Angustiae on one occasion became exasperated and so sterrrly
rebnked them as to declare that either those verses would
have to be removed from the table or he would leave in the
midst of the meal and retire to his chamber. Both Ι a'nd the
others who were at the table experienced this.

CHAPTER XXIII
His use of the church revenues

He was ever mindful of his fellow·poor and for them he
spent from the same funds from which he spent for himself
and all who lived with him, that is, either from the revenues
from the possessions of the church or from the offerings of
the faithful. And when perchance‚ as was frequently the case,
jealousy arose among the clergy regarding these possessione,
Augustine addressed the people of God, saying that he pre·
ferred to live by the contributions oi God's people rather than
be burdened with the care and direction of these possessions
and that he was ready to give them back to them so that all
'the servants and ministers of God might live aiter the man·
