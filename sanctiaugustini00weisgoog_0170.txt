NOTES 163

CHAPTER XXIV

1ad vices: Apparently a late usage instead of the usual iu vicem
or ru arces.

²aliquas eum hereditates recusasse novimus: Augustine refused the
legacy af a ship from Boniface because he thought the Church should
nothe a ship- -owner taking the risle of loss through shipwreck, and
would not accept the estate of anyone who had disinherited his son.
He cites with admiration the example of Aurelius, Archbishop ,of
Carthage, who, on the birth of an heir, promptly returned an estate
which had been given to the church by a man who was childless when
he made the gift: Serm. CCCLV 5.

⁸refrapatr‘oue: A late and rare word. There is an instance in
Augustino: et r'u re facillima quae recte placuerat, curnam refragationem
et aedos difficultatis posuissem: Ep. CCXLI 1.

*ab ea: From Luc. 10:3942.

⁵Interea: “at times”; originally poetic in this sense.

‘’scripsrr: The passage iram Ambrose, unidentified by Possidius,
occurs in his De Officiis minimorum, PL 16, 148450. Ambrose de·
clases that there are three cases in which a bishap may be justified in
melting and selling the sacred vessels: to ransom the captive or relieve
the poor, to build a church, and to enlarge the burial grounds. Victor
Vitensis mentions a similar instance in which Deagratias, Bishop of
Carthage‚ used the gold and silver vessels oi the church to ransom
the prisoners taken by Geiseric: De Persecutiaue Vandalica, PL 58,
191.

⁷ fidelibus: The name ior baptized Christiane as distinguished irorn
catechumeni, the candidates not yet admitted to baptism. Thus Au·
gustine remarks that if anyone says he is a Christian he must then be
asked whether heis catechumenus or fidelis: Tractatus iu Ioannem
XLIV 2.

ἰι praesente: Οἱ course at sometime when Angustiae was in
Milan, 384·387.

CHAPTER XXV

lvestiebatur: Augustine's own references to the daily lile in the
monastery at Hippo are naturally more vivid and intimate than the
matter-ol-iact recital ol Possidius. The following quotations may he
given: Nostis omues aut pene omues, sic uos vium iu ea domo, quae
dicitu· dorma episcopii, ut usmetum potuemus, imitemur eor carmos, de
quibus loquitur tiber Actuum Apostolorum: Nemo dicebat alipm'd
proprium, red eraut illis onmia commuuio: Sermo CCCLV i a. Ecce
quamodo vivimus. Nulli licet iu societate rostra tabere aliquid pro·
