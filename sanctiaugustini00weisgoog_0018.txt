by Possidius²⁶ and even more satisfactorily in two oi Augus·
tine's sermons.²⁰

This monastery which had its beginning at Tagaste and was
later established at Hippo when Augustine became presbyter
there, was the first one in North Africa and the parent of the
other North African monasteries. Possidius
states²⁷ that the bishops who went out from
this monastery at Hippo followed their mas-
ter’s example and established other monaster-
ies in their episcopal sees. Augustine’s original purpose had
been merely to withdraw from the world with a lew friends
and have time ior undisturbed meditation aud prayer. He
pursued this kind of life for almost three years at Tagaste
(388391) until he was forcibly ordained presbyter at Hippo.
After that he continued his purpose, but adapting it to cir-
cumstances, made me monastery rather a school for the train-
ing of the clergy. His conception of the kind of life the clergy
should lead is clearly set forth in two of his sermons.²⁸ He
also established a monastery for women over which his sister
presided, and after her death in 423 wrote them a letter²⁹ to
settle their differences and to gulde thmn in the conduct ol life.

In reviewing the life oi Ροεεὶἀίιιε,20 the first fact to be noted

is that, apart from his relations with Augustine, he is practi-
cally unknown. He first appears as one of the group of inti-
mate friends whom Augustine gathered around him in the
monastery at Hippo and is mentioned only once after Augus·

²⁰ His name, Possidius, is not to be confounded with Possidonins, a
bishop who appears at some of the councils and who, in, coniunctiori
with Possidius, signed the letter addressed hythe Council oi Milevunl
to Pope lnnocentI (Ep. CLXXVI). Manuscript evidence proves that
Possidius, not Possidonius, is the name of Augustine's biographer.
