160 NOTES

response to a letter from the Council oi Carthage held in 416 (Ep.
CLXXV) and the Council oi Milevum‚ held in the same year (Ep.

CLX'XVI). It was again condemned by Zosimus in 418, hythe Em-
peror Honorius in the same year, and again hy Zosimus later. How·
ever it was not till 431, the year following Augustine’s death, that the
heresy was finally condemned hythe Ecumenical Council of Ephesus.

²annos ferme decem: Augustino issued his principal anti-Pelagian
writings in rapid succession in the years 412·421. Aiter an iriterval,
however, four other treatises appeared, two in eadm, and two in
428-429: Teuffel III 371.

⁸Innocentio: Pope nae-417.

*Zosimoe Pope 417·418.

⁶indisciplinati0nes: This late form, with a lew others of like com·
position, means the iailure to keep up to a standard, as is more clearly
brought autin Chapter XXV,

“indiculum This Indicuius, which is the appendix to the Vita
Augustini oi Possidius, is the earliest detailed list oi Augustine's writ-
ings. It is to he iaund in PL 46, 5. Possidius fixes the total oi Au-
gustine's works at 1030. Inspection oi the Indicqus, however, shows
that he counted as a separate work each epistle or sermon known to
him, thus arriving at this large total which, nevertheless, does not
include all that Angustiae wrote, as appears from the statement at the
end oi the indiculus: memoratus sanctus Augustinus episcopus Spiritu
divino actus, in sancta Ecclesia catholica ad instructionem anintarnm

- fecit libros, tractatus, epistolas numero 1030, exceptis iis gui numerari

non possunt, quia nec numerum designauit ipsorum.

At the end of the Retractationes Angustiae states that he had re·
vised opera XCIII in libris CCXXXII, exclusive of his epistles and
sermons. Victor Vitensis, writing in 486, likewise gives the total as
²32 “books'' besides “innumerable” epistles‚ expositions of whole
Psalms and Gospels, and popular sermons: De Persecutione Vandalica
PL58, 185.

Indiculus or indiculum is post-classical and rare.

'causas audiebat: One oi the regular duties of the hishop atthis
time was to hear and decide the cases oi his parishioners. This
iudicial authority had risen gradually till it became very important and
gained the recognition oi the civil government. In the Christian Roman
empire a bishop had power to judge civil and criminal cases not in·
volving capital punishment. See C oden Theudosianas IX 3 7, IX 16 12,
