and vitot, CD* alone agree on victitot; in Chapter XIX CD*
read quanto magis instead of nedum or necuim found in the
other MSS. However C also contains variant readings which
are found in other MSS. and which seem to indicate that C
belongs to a different family than AB. MSS. Ε and F agree
sometimes with ΑΒ and sometimes with C. As their read-
ings are found in ΑΒ or C they may be disregarded as not
outstanding representatives of either group. The final choice,
therefore, as to the best available source for the original text
among these ten MSS. lies between ΑΒ and C. Α is more free
from errors than any of the other nine MSS. and-is also one
of the earliest. Moreover since C contains many readings not
found in the other MSS. it cannot be regarded as a pure text,
for if it were, it is highly improbable that none of the other
nine MSS, except only D*, should contain any trace what·
soever oi these readings, many of which differ radically from
the readings in the other MSS.⁶⁸ The reading oi CD* in
Chapter XIX cited above is probably an alteration to the Vul-
gate reading. Such alterations are not infrequent in C and

- are a further illustration of the liberties which the writer of

C took with the text. For these reasons the MSS. ΑΒ, of
which Α is the better representative,⁸‘ seem to iumish a text
which resembles the archetype more closely than any of the
other MSS. CDEFGHJK. Accordingly A has been adopted
as the main basis of the text and followed rather closely.
Its variant readings are fully noted in the apparatus criticus.

A partial list of MSS. of the Vita, as complete as could be
made from available sources, is herewith given.

⁶³ These variants in C are so numerous that they could not all be
included in the apparatus criticus. They are therefore given only
when they have some direct bearing on readings in other MSS.

⁶⁴ The choice of A in preference to Β as the purer representative of
the ΑΒ family follows naturally after a comparison of the two MSS.
Evidence, if necessary, may be found iu the apparatus criticus.
