LIFE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE 49

understood with greater comprehension and mourned as he
apprehended the many innninent dangers which threatened his
life in the direction and government of the church, and for this
reason he wept. But their desire was accomplished as they
wished.

CHAPTER V

, He establishes a monastery

Soon after he had been made presbyter he established a
monastery within the church and began to live with the ser-
vants of God according to the manner and rule instituted by

the holy apostles. The principal rule of this society was that ’

no one should possess anything of his own, but that all things
should be held in common and be distributed to each one as
he had need, as Augustine had formerly done after he returned
to his native horne from across the sea. But the holy Valerius
who ordained him, a good man fearing God, rej0iced and
gave thanks to God He said the Lord had heard the prayers
which he had unceasinglya poured forth· that divine Providence
would grant him such a man, who by his salutary teaching of
the Word of God could edify the Church of the Lord. For
Valerius, a Greek by birth and less versed in the Latin lan-
guage and literature, saw that he himself was less useful for
this end. therefore he gave his presbyter the right of
preaehing the Gospel in his presence in the church and very
frequently of holding public discussions-contrary to the prae· ’
tice and custom of the* African thurches. On this account
some bishops found fault with him. But the venerable and
prudent man knew well that this was the custom in the Eastern
churches and considered only the weliare of the Chumh and
took no notice of the words oi his detractors, if only his pres-
byter might do that which he saw could not be accomplished
