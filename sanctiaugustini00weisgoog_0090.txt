CHAPTER XVIII

Heretics of the new Pelagian sect overcome
and ooudenmed

Against the Pelagians also, new heretics ol our time and
skilful debaters, who wrote with an art even more subtle and
noxious, and spoke whenever they could, in public and in
homes-against these he iabored for almost ten years, writing
and publishing many books and very frequently arguing in the
church with people of that error. When they perversely tried
through their flattery to persuade the Apostolie See of their
false doctrine, it was most positively resolved by [successive]
African councils of holy bishops first to convince the venerable
Innocent, the holy Pope of the city, and his successor, the holy
Zosimus, that this sect ought to be aborninated and condemned
hythe Catholic saith. And the bishops oi that great See at
various times censured' them and cut them off from the memÎ‡
bership of the Church, and in letters sent to the African
churches of the West and to the churches oi the East decreed
that they should be anathamatized and shunned by all Catho-
lics. When the most pious Emperor Honorius heard of this
judgment which had been passed upon them by the Catholic
Church oi God, influenced by it, he in turn decreed that they
should be condenmed by his laws and should be regarded as
heretice. Accordingly some of them returned to the bosom oi
the holy mother Church from which they had withdrawn.
