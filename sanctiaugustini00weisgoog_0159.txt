llibris confectis et repentinis sermonibus: In this connection con·
fectis means composed, written or finished and repentinis, “sudden”
oti-hand, not prepared ia writing, extempore. Thus Sidonius Apolli·
naris IX 3, 5, contrasts praedicationes repentinus with praedicationes
elucubratas.

²areisquis . . . adhibentes: For qusquis with a singular verb and a
plural participle compare Augustine's similar but less extremely ab·
normal ammonuitque populum utillum [serpentem] exaltatum qnis-
quis a serpente morderetur attenderet,· hoc facientes continno sana·
bantur: De Peccatorum Meritis 1 xxxii 61.

⁸odorque amvissimus Christi: From Eph. 5ze.

*nianipestatm The post-classical verb manifesto is often used by
Augustino, especially in the participal torm, as manifestatum est mihi:
confessiones VII xii 18; ex nranifestato in earne Christo: Contra duas
Epistulas Pelagianorum IV iii 3. Augustine also uses it as a substan-

tive: per se ipsa manifestata delectant: De Doctrina Christiana IV
xii 28. Resides this instance in Possidius it again occurs in Chapter

XIV: cunctis manifestata and Chapter XXXI: vixisse manifestatur.
⁵Quorn'am . . . numbra: From 1 Cor. 12:26.

CHAPTER VIII

lprimatem episcoporum Cartbapinensem: Aurelius, the archbishop
oi &ethnae ior thirty-five years (388-423) in a period ol critical im-
portance. His confirmation was required for the election of a bishop
in any city of Africa. He also convoked and presided over the vari·
ous plenary couneils held almost every year. He co-operated with
Augustino in suppressing the Donatist schism, agreeing with him in a
policy of moderatiori and appealing to the civil governrnent only when
the Donatist outrages and fanaticism became unbearable. Four ol
Augustine’s epistles are addressed to Aurelius: XXII, XLI, LX,

²Mepatio calamensi episcopo: Megalius was the immediate prede-
cessor oi Possidius as bishop of Calama, a North African town about
sorry miles south-west ol Hippo Regius. His aversion to Augustius
led him to oppose his election as coadjutor-bishop to Valerius, bishop
of Hippo Regius, and he brought lorward cert-ain serious drarges
against him. These, however, he was unable to prove and was com·
pelled to retract them. He became reconciled to Augustine and in
39¹ consecrated him as coadiutor to Valerius. He died in 397, the year
aiter Valerius died. Accordingly within the one year (394397) Va·

lerius was succeeded by Angustiae as bishop ot Hippo and Megalius
was succeeded by Possidius as bishop ol Calama.
