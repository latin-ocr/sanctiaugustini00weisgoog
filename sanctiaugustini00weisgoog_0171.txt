CHAPTER XXVI

²quae pariter Deo serviebant: Augustino had established a uunnery
at Hippo Regius of which his sister was prioress and to which the
daughters oi his brother Navigius also belonged. This seems to have
been the first nunnery in Africa, though later than those founded by
J erome and :Paula in Palestine in 384 After the death oi Augustine’s
sister in 423 dissension arose among the nuns over the appointment
of Felicitas as her successor. Augustine wrote them a stetu letter oi
rebuke and, improving the opportunity, laid down a code oi strict
rules ior their conduct: Ep. ccx1.

The name of Augustine’s sister is not certainly known. Chureh tte·
ditior gives it as Perpetua See the Bollandistes, Vies des Saints
