INTRODUCTION

Our knowledge of the life of Augustine, Bishop of Hippo,
is derived from two main sources: (1) Augustine's own C on-
fessiones, covering the period up to the time of his conversion

in 387 and setting forth chiefly the history of
nom„ y„ η, his spiritual development, and (2) the Vita
Lite ⁰l ‘mum‘ Augustini of Possidius, covering the time from

Augustine’s conversion to his death in 430 and
containing a record of his daily life and activities. Outside
of these two main sources many references also occur in his
other writings, chiefly in the Epistles

Aurelius Augustinus was born at Tagaste in Numidia on
November 13, 354,1 about seven years after chrysostom and
fourteen after Jerome and Ambrose. After spending a free

and careless boyhood at Tagaste, he pursued
Early Luc the usual course of grammar and rhetoric at

Madaura and Carthage and after-ward taught
lor a short time in his native town. In 374 he returned to
Carthage and taught rhetoric for nine years. During this
period he became deeply interestedin Manichaeanism, merely as
an auditor, however, and not as one of the electi. It was here
he met the famous Manichaean teacher Faustus from whom
he expected much, but soon found that, despite his gorgeous
rhetoric, he was unable to answer any searching questions.
Dissatislied with his life at Carthage and secking a larger
career, he went to Rome. Moreover he had heard that the
students ol Rome were better behaved than those at Carthage.

absuper, in his chronicon, states that Augustine died August 28,
43ο; Possidius says it was in the third month of the siege of Hippo,
and also that he died at the age of seventysix. Augustine himself

gives the day of his birth: Idibus Novembris ruhi notulis dies erut:
De Beata Vita i 6,
