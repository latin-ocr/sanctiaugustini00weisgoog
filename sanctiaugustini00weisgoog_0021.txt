tempted to stop the celebrat' t,10n but were driven back into the

to pass unnoticed and carried the case before the proper
authorities who promised to exact the penalty imposed by the

of the pagane be destroyed and their temples be confiscated for
public use, was no doubt provoked by this disturbance.

To this period belong Possidius’s two journeys to Italy.
Though only one is generally mentioned, there were evidently
two. The first was occasioned by the recent pagan uprising³²
and to'ok place after July 408 and before March 27, 409.
This date is made clear by a letter of Augustine in which he
says that on March 27 he received an answer to a letter he,
ha'd written about eight months before, when Possidius had
