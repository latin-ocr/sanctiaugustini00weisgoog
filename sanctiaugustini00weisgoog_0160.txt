⁸coutra marem Ecclesiae: Angustiae thought that the consecration
of the successor ta a bishop while that bishop was yet living had no
sanction in ecclesiastical custom. Valerius, however, was able to cite .
some exceptions, as Augustine himself states: nonnullis iam exemplis
praecedentibus, auibus nuli omnir excusatio claudebatur: Ep. XXXI 4.

He learned much later of the prohibition in the eighth canon of the ·
· Council oi Nicaea held in 325: Adhuc incorpore posita beatae ment·

oriae parre et episcopo meo sene V aleria, episcopus ordinatus arm, et
sedi cum illo: quod concilia Nicaeno prohibitum fuisse nesciebam, nce
ipse sciebat: Ep. CCXIII 4 Nevertheless the canon of Nicaea, while
providing against two bishops in one diocese, left the way open lor
ordaining a coadjutor to the bishop, if the bishop so desired. The
ordination oi Augustine was therefore entirely lawiul.

¹ ⁴nec . . . aliis ficri voluit: On September 26, 426 Augustine pro-
posed in an assembly of bishops, clergy and people held at Hippo
Regius that the presbyter Heraclius should relieve him oi his seculae
cares in order that he might devote himself entirely to ffle study oi the
Scriptores. He asked that Heraclius should succerd him as bishop,
but in deference to what he believed to be the prohibition of the
Council of Nicaea, and in view ol the blame he had himself received
for becoming a bishop while Valerius was yet alive, he announced

that Heraclius would remain a presbyter till the proper time came ior
making him a bishop: Ep. CCXIII 4, 5.

⁵conciliis constitueretur episcoporum: This action was taken by the
Third Council oi Carthage in 397, canon III: Item placuit, ut ardi-
nandis episcopis vel clericus, prius ob ordinatoribus suis decreta con-
ciliorum auribus eorum inculcentur, nc se aliquid contra statuta eon-
cilii fecisse asserant: Collectio Consiliorum III 880.

²Donatirtae: The Donatist schism was local, not extending beyond
North Ainea. It arose from a question of the discipline oi the tra·
dilores, namely those who had surrendered the sacred writings during
the Diocletian persecution, 303-311. In 311 a division arose over the
election oi Caecilianus as bishop of Carthage, the opposition party
declaring ft invalid because Felix, who had performed the ordination
service, was a traditor, and because the Numidian bishops had had no
vote in the election. Majorinus was elected as counter-bishop and on
his death in 315 was succeeded by Donatus, called the Great‚ from
whom the party received its name. Since they regarded themselves as
the only pure ehurch-all the others being traditores—they required
all converts to be rebaptizet: see Ep. LXVI to Crispinus. They were
