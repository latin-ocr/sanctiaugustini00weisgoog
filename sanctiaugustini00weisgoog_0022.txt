also appear that Possidius was expected to return shortly, lor
Augustine suggests that possibly the citizens of Calama had
heard a rumor that Possidius had obtained authority to punish
them more seuerely (severius),⁸⁴ though no such report had
as yet reached him.

The other visit to the imperial court was on an ernbassy ap·
pointed by a council which met at Carthage on July 1, 410.u
The purpose oi this embassy wasto secure the renewal ol the
laws against the Donatists which had been temporarily sus· ’
pended,⁸⁸ Possidius and his colleagues seem to have accomp-
lished their purpose, ior in August 410 Honorius issued a de-

At the great Collatia of 411 between the Catholics and Do-

pp. 41·42) it ought to read Hortarii VIII et Theodosii 111, and this
could apply to either 40⁹ or 410. Accordingly 410 has been adopted as
being the more probable. This date is also given in the margin oi
Mansi’s edition, though 409 is giren in the index.
