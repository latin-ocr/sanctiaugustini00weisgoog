158 NOTES.

remark oi Emeritus: Gesta indicant, sinicius sum out vici: si venitote
vietus suns out potestate oppressus surm De Gestis eum Emenso, PL
43, 700. The Gesta referred to by Emeritus are the proceedings oi the
Conference ot Carthage iu 411, Mansi IV 7-246.

⁵nit, et cnm reticeret: Ait, the reading of the MSS as opposed to
that oi the editions, is supported by Angustiae: Emeritns episcopus
portis Donoti dixit notorio qui excipiebat: Foc. Cumque reticeret . . .:
De Gestis eum Emerito, PL 43, 7oo.

⁶resto: De Gestis cum Emerito, PL 43, 697.

CHAPTER XV

1eredo . . . voluerit: Α post-classical and mild consessive use or
credo (somewhat like lieet) ioIned directly with the subjunctive with·

out quod or any intervening word in the sense oi “supposing,” “per-
haps’' or “maybe.”

²Firmus: Probably unknown, as PossidIus’s quidam would seem to
imply. The Firmus mentioned in Epp. CLXXXIV 7, CXCI 1, CXCIV
1, and CCXLVIII e was doubtless another¹ person.

⁸sonctum . . . benediximus: From Psalm 102: 1.

⁴per scientes . . . animarum: For similar phrasIng compare Augus·
tine: sed utens tu ominbus et scientibus et nescientibus ordine quo
nosti: confessiones VI viii 12.

CHAPTER XVI

¹Ursnm: Augustine also mentions the activity oi this Ursus, a
Roman tribune, against the Manichaeens at Carthage: instante Urso
tribuno, qui tnnc domni repioe praefuit: De Hoesesibus XLVI. Ursus
also caused (4²1?) the famous temple oi the Dea Coelestis at Carthage
to be razed to the ground and the site to be used as a Christian
cemetery: Liber de Promissiombus, PL 51, 835.

²od tubulos: i.e. in the presence of the notorii who took down in
short-hand both questions and answers on their tablets (od tabulas).

⁸Feliee: This discussion with Felix took place on December 7 and
12, 404: De Actis cum Felice Monichoeo, PL 42, 519 and 535. From
the acts oi the second day it appears ¹that the books of Felix had been
confiscated and were being guarded under the public seal. This and
Felix's recentation at the end give the debate almost the appearance
ofatrial.

⁴frustroto: In this sense post-Augustam and very rare.

¹⁵sieut . . . scripturo: This record is found in De Actis eum Feiiee
Moniehneo, PL 42, 519.
