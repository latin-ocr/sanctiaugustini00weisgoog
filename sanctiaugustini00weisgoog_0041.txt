The work oi Salinas, however, has a distinct value. Apart
from the earlier Benedictine edition, it is the first edition which
attempts to be critical. Its general review oi the text, though ·
not made by scientific method, represents a certain advance
over anything done before, and the information in the notes
is usually reliable.

There are three other editions which deserve brief notice.
The Migne edition (1865) is merely a reprint oi the Benedic-
tine edition with a comparison oi Salinas and the addition oi
his critical notes. The text in the Acta Sanctorum (Paris,
1866) is a reprint oi the text oi Salinas with variant readings
from Q. There is also an edition by Hurter in Sanctorum
Patrem Opuseala S electa, Innsbruck 1895. The source oi the
text is not evident‚ as it agrees neither with the Benedictirre
nor Salinas edition, but seems to result from a capricious al-
teration oi both. It abounds in errors ol omission, transposi-
tions and even has insertions which appear nowhere else, either
in the ten MSS. used or in the editions. However it contains
some valuable comments and a few selections from the critical
notes oi Salinas.

The textus receptus evidently dates back to the early edi-
tions, at least to the Louvain edition oi 1564. Many liberties
have been taken in altering the text, chiefly to fit the rules oi

classical grammar or to make it read more
The Text smoothly. Instances are the substitution of

the accusative ior the ablative, ia ipsas moa-
tium silom et ravanus petrarum et speluncas eonfupientes:
XXVIII; the subjunctive ior the indicative, praedicaret: IX;
the imperfect lor the pluperfect subJunctive, deneparet: XIV;
a change to a more suitable conjunction, secl ior et: XIV;
petitus iret for petitum ire: XXVII, to avoid an abrupt change
of construction; astantem ior assistentem: XXVII, lor no rea-
son at all apparently; the unnecessary insertion oi debeo:
Praei„ to complete the sentence3 the omission of nam and in-
sertion of autem: XXXI, and the substitution of the ablative
absolute for the accusative, eisque compertis for eaque com-
