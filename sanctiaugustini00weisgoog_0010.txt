PREFACE

Ι take this opportunity of expressing my gratitnde to Dean
A. F. West for his constant help and guidance in the prepara·
tion of this edition. It was beguai at his suggestion and has
been continually under his direction. I am further indebted to
Professor J. H. Westcott lor assistance on certain law terms,
to Professor Duane Reed Stnart for his thorough criticisms,
especially of the text, and also to Professor P. van den Ven
and Dr. R J. Deferrari for valuable suggestions in the recon-
struction of the text. Owing to war conditions abroad it was
impracticable to examine the MSS. of the Vita in the libraries
where they are deposited. Accordingly teu of the older MSS.
in the Bibliotheque Nationale and the Vatican were se·
cured in photostatic copies, under the supervision of M. Henri
Omont, ¹Conservateur des Mannscrits, and of the late Director
Jesse Benedict Carter and Professor Albert W. Van Buten
oi the American Academy in Rome. Thanks are also due to
Mr. Gordon W. Thayer, Librarian of the J. G. White Collec-
' tion, Cleveland Public Library, for providing me with notices
of certain MSS. ol the Vita from catalogues otherwise un-
available. The map was prepared by my friend* Dr. W. E.
Cockfield on the basis ol the map in Volume VIII of the C or-
pus Inscriptionum Lothrorum.
