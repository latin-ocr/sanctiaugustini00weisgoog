LIFE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE 1²9

through thy knowledge, but through thine ignorante shall the
weak brother perish, for whom Christ died.

7. But as ior those who are not deceived by error in this
matter, but are overcome by terror, why should they not
rather, with the rnercy and aid oi the lord, bravely struggle
against their iright, lest incomparably greater and more tear-
ful evils corne upon thern? This will be the case where the
love oi God is aflame, not where the desire oi this world
smoulders. For love says: ‘Who is wealr and I arn not weak?
Who is offended and Ι burn not ?' And love‘ is from God.
Let us pray, therefore, that this love be given oi Him by
whom it is commanded. And because oi it let us tear that the
sheep ol Christ, who will die at some time by some kind of
death, may be slain in heart by the sword of spiritual wicked-
ness rather than in the body by one of iron. Let us rather iear ·
that the inner sense may be corrupted and the purity ot iaith
perish than that women be forcibly defiled in body. For chas-
tity is not destroyed in the body when the will oi the sufferer
does not shamefully take part in the deeds of the flesh, but
without consenting endures another’s violence. Rather let us
iear that the living stones may be destroyed while we are
absent than that the stenes and wood ol the earthly buildings '
may be burned while we are present. Rather let us fear that

· the members of Christ’s body may be destroyed when deprived

oi spiritual nourishment than that the members oi our body
may be put to tortore when overpowered by the attack of the
enemy. Not that these things are not to be avoided when pos-

sible, but rather that they are to be endured when they cannot Ἴ

be avoided without impiety-unless, perchance, someone will
maintain that the minister is not impious who withdraws his
ministry which is needful for piety at the time when it is most
needlul.
