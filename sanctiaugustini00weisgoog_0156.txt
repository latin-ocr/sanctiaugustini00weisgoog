phrase: Erunt autem ex eis quos dicum ugentes in rebus: C onfessiones
VIII vi 15. These officere had various duties principally as messengers,
tax collectors and police agents. For a detailed statement oi theIr
duties see Pauly-Wissowa, Reol-Encyclopddie Ι, 776 ff. Evodius, Aug·
ustine’s pupil who was bishop oi Uzelis, had been one of the rpentes
in rebus: C onfersiones IX viii 17.

*Hipporum-replum: Called Hippo Regius because it had been the
iavorite residence oi the Numidian kings, thus distinguishing it from
Hippo Diarrhytus, near Utica. This flonrishing scaport‚ about one
hundred and fiity miles west of Carthage, was also the capital ol its
district. It is referred to by classical writers. As early as 255 a
certain Theogenes, Bishop of Hippo Regius, is mentioned as attending
aCouncil oi Carthage, but the historical importance ol the city began
when Angustiae became its last bishop and ended with its iourteen
months' siege and subsequent oepture by the Vandals. Τὴο siege
ended in 431, the year following Augustine’s death After further
conflict the possession ol the city was finally conceded to the Vandals
by treaty in 435. See Hodglcin II 247·252· The Christian basilica was
one of the most prominent buildings oi the city (De Ciuitate Dei XXII
viii 9) and bore the name of Ecclesia Poris: Ep. CCXIII 1. The
writings oi Augustine mention seven separate churches or chapels in
Hippo: Leclercq, L'Asrique Chrbtierme II 26, 30-31. The city was
finally destroyed in the seventh century by the Arabs. The modern
town oi Bona is built near its ruins.

CHAPTER IV

²Volerr'us: Valerius, who died in 396, was Augustine's immediate
predecessor as bishop oi Hippo. Compare Chapter VIII, note 3 on
contro morem Ecclesiae. His wisc and generous nature is revealed
not so much in his loresight in ehoosing such a rarely promising young
convert as Augustine to be his successor, as in his unselfish ca're for the
weliare oi his people and the advancement of the Church. He was so
iar from allowing any sense oi personal rivalry to hinder the career oi
his brilliant young asssistant that he even created a new custom in the
African churches and gave Augustius, the presbyter, the right to
preach in his presence: Possidius‚ Vita Aupustini V.

2εειιινιιε et ignarus: This is fully corroborated by Augustine's own
