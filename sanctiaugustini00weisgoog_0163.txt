ties, and the third the debate here mentioned which ended in the
proconsular condemnation of Crispinus.

²² libellari: “formally recorded.’' The English word “libellam'' has
the same sense. This term oi Roman law means the libel or written
statement oi his cause oi action 'made by the plaintiff at the beginning
oi a suit. See the word in the Oxiord English Dictionary. The
“libellary sentence” passed on Crispinus is a formal written statement
explaining and justilying the sentence.

18auraria mulcta: In Ep. LXXXVIII 7, sent by the clergy oi Hippo
to Januarius, a Donatist bishop in Numidia, but evidently written by
Augustino, the amount of the fine is stated as poeria decem librarum
auri. Compare also Contra Cresconium Donatistam III xlvii 51. Fines
were prescribed as the penalty for the Donatist heretics by the Emp-
eror Theodosius: see PL 11, 1420.

1⁴ officium: Officium in the legal sense oi the body oi officials or
court officere is usual in the time ol Augustino. Compare Paulus
episcopus dixit: Novit officium publicum, id est Edesius et lunius ex·
ceptores: Contra Cresconium‚ PL= 43, 513; and . . . sicut interrogatum
respondit Officium: Breviruius collationis cum Donatistis, PL 43, 616.
See also PL 43, 621, 643-644 and Serm. LXVI 1.

Honorius from Rome to Africa in 411 with authority to hear and
judge the controversy between the Donatists and Catholics. Ae·
cordingly he presided at the celebrated Conference ot carthage held
tha-t same year, at which the Donatist schism was condemned and ei-
fectually cheeked. Because of his decision in favor oi the Catholics,
the Donatists accused him of accepting a bribe: Optatus, Historia
Donatistarum, PL 11, 8203 Ep. CXLI r, 12.

Augustine's acquaintance with Marcellmus evidently began atthis
time and quickly ripened into intimacy. Iu compliance with his request
Augustine began writing the De Ciuitate Dei in 412 (I Praei, ΙΙ 1)
and also dedicated to him the De Peccatorum Meritis et Remissione
and De Spiritu et Littera. Four letters from Augustine to him are still
extant.

In 413 Marcellinus was arrested, probably at the instigation ot the
Donatists: Jerome, Contra Pelopionos, PL 23, 616 ; Orosius, Historia,
PL 31, 1171. Although Augustino intervened in his behalf and received
assorauce of his safety and prompt release, Mamilium, together with
