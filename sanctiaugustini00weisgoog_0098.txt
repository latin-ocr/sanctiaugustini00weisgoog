LIFE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE 91

he interceded by letter with a Vicar oi Africa, Macedonius
by name, on behalf of a suppliant, Macedonius granted the re·
quest and sent him an answer on this wise: “I am struck with
wonder at your wisdom hoth in the books you have published
and in this letter which you have not found it too great a
burden to send me by way of intercession for those in distress. J
For the former writings, my venerable lord and esteemed ia-
ther, possess a discernment, wisdom and holiness which leave
nothing to he desired, and the latter such modesty‚ that unless
I do as you request, I could not regard myseli as remaining
iree irom blame in the matter. Yon do not insist, like most
men in your position, on extorting all that the supplia'nt asks.
But what seemed to you fair to ask oi a judge occupied with
many cares, this you advise with a humhle modesty which is
most efficacious in settling difficulties among good men. Con-
sequently Ι have not hesitated to grant your request as you
recommended and as 1 had given you reason to expect.''

CHAPTER XXI

¹His irame of mind when attending councils

Whenever he was afile, Augustine attended the councils oi
the holy priests which were held throughout the various pro·
vinces, seeking in them not his own but the things oi Jesus
Christ, that the iaith ol the holy Catholie Church might re·
main inviolate or that some priests and clergy who had been
justly or uniustly excommunicated might he either absolved
or rejected. In the ordination oi priests and clergy he thought
that the agreement of the majority oi Christians and the cus-
tomos the Church should be followed.
