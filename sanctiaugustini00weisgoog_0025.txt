18 INTRODUCTION

‘imm‘ ably the most significant oi these is found in

References ω. Ep. CI, addressed toa certain Bishop Memor,
Possidius in which Augustine discloses his affection ior

Possidius by calling him “no small image of
my own self”: Nimis autem inpratunt ac ferreum fuit, ut te
qui nos sic amas, hic sanctus frater et'collepa noster Possidius,
iu quo nostram nan parvam praesentiam reperies, vel non dis·

ceret, vel sine litteris nastris disceret. Est enim per nostrum
. ministerium non litteris illis, quas variarum seriei libidinum
liberales vocant, sed dominico pane nutritus, quantus ei potuit
per nostras anpustias dispensat. This is Augustine’s fullest
reference to Possidius and as it agrees so well with Possidius’s
own statements it serves to confirm aur faith in him. An·
other letter written about this same time, while not so perti-
nent, still deserves notice. It begins in this manner: Cum vos
fratres' nostri coniunctissimi nobis, quos nobiscum desiderati
desiderare et salutati resalutare consuestis, assidue vident, non
tam augentur bona nostra, quaen consolantur natan Though
Augustine may here be speaking in general terms, yet he
means Possidius in particular, ior he at once proceeds to name
him as the person he has in mind The other references to
Possidius are of less importance and need only to be indicated.
He concludes Ep. CXXXVII to Volusianus with a greeting
from Possidius who is evidently visiting him, and in the De
Ciuitate Dei XXII viii he speaks of a cure supposed to have
been effected by a relic which the bishop oi Calama had
brought to that city. ·

Because oi this prolonged and intimate friendship. Possidius
was peculiarly fitted ior the task he undertook. He had ob-
served Augustine’s daily life continuously forat least five years.
He had seen him in the various phases of his work as teacher

and administrator: instructing the people or
His secutae the clergy or managing the funds oi the
siffffilw church, or caring for the poor and the widows
or judging the disputes of his parishioners.
