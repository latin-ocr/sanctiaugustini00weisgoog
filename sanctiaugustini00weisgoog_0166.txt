CHAPTER XVII

¹Paucentio: The date oi this controversy with Pascentius is un·
certain. As a sequel to the public debate Augustine wrote three letters
to Pascentius (ccxxxvnl, CCXXXIX, CCXLI) but received only
one short reply (Ep. CCXL). Outside these letters and the account
oi Possidius there seems to be no definite information regarding the
controversy.

²Ariano: The Arian heresy which affected the whole Christian
world, was so named from the presbyter Arius oi Alexandria, who
taught in regard to the Trinity that the -Son is notai the same sub·
stance with the Father, but of like substance, and is not coeternal,
but the first oi all creatures. This teaching was condemned at the
Ecumenical Council oi Nicaea in 325· Fierce oontroversies followed
and various synods were held. Jovian, Valentioian Ι and Gratian
granted toleration to both parties. Arianism declined and was virtu-
ally suppressed in the Roman world in the times oi Theodosias I
(amnas) and Valentinum 11 (ers-³92)- ’

⁸Maninnno: This discussion on the Trinity between Maximinus,
the Arian bishop oi Hippo Regius, and Angustiae was held at Hippo
Regius in 427 or 428; see PL 42, 707, The report of the collatio shows
that Maximinus skiliully avoided Augustine's direct questions and
took so much time in his final presentation that Angustiae had no
sufficient opportunity to answer: PL 42, 709742. Augustine resented
this and composed a prompt and iull reply in his two books Contra
Maximinum: PL 42, 743—814 In his opening sentence he makesa
pointed thrust at Maximinus: eteius prolixitate spatium diei, qno
praesentes conferebamus, absumpsit.

There was another Maximinus, Catholic bishop oi Sinita, near Hippo
Regius, who is mentioned by Angustiae In De Civitate Dei XXII viii 6
and elsewhere.

²Pelapianistas: The Pelagian heresy, which arose in the time ai
Augustine, received its name irom Pelagius, a British monlr ( 360-
420): Peiapionornm ert haeresis . . . a Pelopia monacha exorta: De
Haeresibns LXXXVIII. He held that the human will is sufficient
without divine grace to fulfill the commanda oi God. Augustine inr-
mediately aroused the Church against this new heresy and tecam its
principal antagonist in his copious anti-Pelagian writings. which cx·
ertcd a profound and lasting influence. The doctrine oi Pelagius was

promptly condemned by Innocent I (ΕΜ). CLXXXI, CLXXXII) iu
