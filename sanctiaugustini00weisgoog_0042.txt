In some of these instances the readings oi the editions perhaps
may find support in MSS. not available for this edition, but
the changes are altogether too numerous and too nice to be
anything but an attempt at wholesale text-improvement. This
text was unquestioningly adopted by later editions, without so
much as an indication of the manuscript readings at many such
places. Nevertheless, despite the alterations made by editors,
the main body of the text is clear in all the manuscripts con-
sulted, and the area of disputable readings, significant or in-
significant, is only about eight hundred words out oi a total
of over twelve thousand.

In basing the text on ΑΒ, the best group of the MSS. 'fl-K,
it becomes clear that while there are no difficulties in the form
ol lacunae or corrupt passages ol extended length, there are
many readings, principally of individual words, which need
exact determination. All these readings have been minutely
examined and tested by the weight oi the manuscript evidence
available and a comparison ol the usage oi Possidius in other
instances. Such alterations in the text as have been made
without manuscript authority in previous editions have been

opposed to the editions on p. 44 Further instances oi this sort ol text
correction where the evidence oi the MSS. is unanimously opposed to the
editions, are recorded in the apparatus criticus. In some other cases
when the MSS. vary, the editions nevetheless present some individual
readings unsupported by any ol the MSS.
