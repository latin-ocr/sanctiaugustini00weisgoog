a' public discussion with Crispinus, the Donatist bishop of Ca-
lama, which the lattm each tIme avoided A few days after
the second refusal, while Possidius was travelling through his
diocese, another Crispinus, a Donatist presbyter and perhaps
a relative of the bishop Crispinus, attacked him, setting fire to
the house in which he took refuge. As the bishop Crispinus
did not even reprove his presbyter for this unprovoked attack,
