pears at two other councils. At that οῖ Milevum in 416³⁹ he
joined with other bishops in signing a letter,⁴⁰ written prob·
ably by Augustiue, to Innocent I, calling attention to the new·
born Pelagian heresy and requesting that it be suppressed
Shortly afterwards, together with his old friends oi the mon·
astery at Hippo, Angustiae, Alypius, Evodius and one out·
sider, Aurelius, Bishop of Carthage, he signed another letter⁴²
to Innocent, urging that this same heresy be formally de·
nounced. The other council, though it Is scarcely to be dig-
nified by so important a name, was that held at Caesarea in
418, to which the Donatist bishop ¹Emeritus was invited.⁴²
When the Vandals invaded Africa in 428, Calama was one
of the many towns which fell into their hands. Possidius took
refuge with Augustine at Hippo, one of the three cities which
still maintained their independence. There he witnessed the
death oi Augustino ln 43ο and remained till the siege oi Hippo
was abandoned by the Vandals in 431.⁴⁸ By or before the
time an agreement was reached in 435 between the Roman
Emperor and the Arian Geiseric, Possidius no doubt returned
to his former charge, where he probably remained unmolested
as long as he performed his duties quietly and did not attract
the attention of the Arian authorities. In 437, however, when
Geiseric endeavored to substitute Arianism for the Catholic
saith, Possidius and several other bishops were driven from
their sees because they refused to yield to the demands oi the
Vandal ruler.⁴⁴ This is the last we hear oi Possidius. He
may have gone to Italy, but there is no evidence to that effect.

, He is honored by the Catholic Church on May 17.
