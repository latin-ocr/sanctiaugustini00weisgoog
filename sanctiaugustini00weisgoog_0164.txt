his elder brother Apringius, was hurriedly and secretly put to death

September 13, 413: Optatus, Historia Donatistarum, PL 11, 821. Aug-
ustine exposed the treachery of his murder and also paid a touching
tribute to his noble character: Ep. CLI 5, 6 and 8. Alter bis death
the legal decisione of Marcell-inus were confirmed: Codex Theodosium

Jerorne¹s Ep. CXXVI is addressed to Marcellinus in answer to the
latter’s questions on the origin oi the soul and refers him to Augustino
ior fuller instruction. After the death of Marcellinus a treatise on
this subject, De Oriaine Animae Hominis, was composed by Angustiae
and sent to Jerome in 415: Ep. CLXVI.

CHAPTER XIV

²qui dicerent: The objection oi the Donatist bishops that they had
not been tried by an impartial tribunal was valid, lor the Emperor
Honorius and his delegate Marcellinus were committed in advance to
a hostile decision. The contention ol Possidius that the Donatist
bishops by consenting to attend the Conterence agreed to abide by its
decision has no force, since the Donatist bishops really had no alterna·
tive. Notwithstanding Augustine's full explanation In the De Gestis
cum Emerita, PL 43, 697, hIs consent to this uniair trial reveals the
extent to which he had departed from his earlier attitude oi toleration
which was well stated in Ep. XXXIV 1 to the Donatist Eusebius,
written in 396: neque me id apere ut ad communionem catholicam
quisquam copatur invitus. His intolerant application of “capite in·
trard' dates from about 408: Ep. XCIII ii 5.

²in Caesariensi Mauritaniae ciuitate constitutus: Angustiae also
mentions this visit to Julia Caesarea: tamen auia illae [litterae] quas ad
Mauritaniam Caesariensem misisti, me apud Caesaream praesente
venerunt, aua nos iniuncta nobis a venerabili papa Zosimo apostoticae
Sedis episcopo ecelesiastica necessitas traxerat: Ep. CXC 1. In another
letter written soon after he again reiers to this visit: Cum vero inde
(a Carthauine) dipressi sumus, perreximus usaue ad Mauritaniam
Caesariensem, auo nas ecclesiastiea necessitas traxit: Ep. CXCIII 1.

⁸Emeritum: Donatist bishop oi Julia Caesarea. He was present at
the Conterence oi Canthage in 411: PL 11, 1228 The meeting oi
Catholic bishops described by Possidius was held at Julia Caesarea in
418 and on that occasion Augustino unsuccessiully tried to persuade
Emeritos to return to the Catholic Church: De Gestis eum Emerita,
PL 43, 697, and later addressed to hima letter now lost: Retractationes
