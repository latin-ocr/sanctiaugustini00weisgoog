INTRODUCTION

As one oi the earliest copies giving the complete text
with iewer and less serious errors than any other, it is
clearly the best oi the ten MSS. It is careiully written
in an excellent hand and presents only occasional er-
rors. The observable errors in Α are confined to 35
instances of haplography, its characteristic fault, 25 er-
roneous substitution of single letters, perhaps 5 impos·
’ ’ sible readings, and some easily 'detected and insignifi-
cant other slips here and there. They are all noted in
the apparatus criticus.⁵⁹ This MS. seems to be quoted
once, but inaccurately, by the Benedictine editors under

in them is the initial Sancti Aupnstim' Vita, followed by some sort of
reference to Possidius as the author, who is characterized as bishop
in every instance but one where his name appears. Ι have taken as a
provisional title Sancti Augustini Vita scripta a Possidio Episcopo, the
heading given in A. ’ ⁸ ““ ’

In all the MSS. consulted the body oi the text is continuone, even in
the iragrnentary MSS, without any division into chapters, and con-
sequently without any chapter titles. In a few cases there are con-
secutive Roman numerals entered at the side of the text at irregular
intervalS, but not continuing beyond the earlier part of the text lt
is of course possible that these may have been intended by one or
another scribe to indicate chapter divisione, but as they do not agree
with each other nor extend through the body of the text nor cor-
respond to the natural literary divisions, they may be disregarded as
insignificant

⁵⁹ Some examples of these ¹faults are altusque ior alitusque Chap-
ter I, manente lor numeres and the omission of ac perficere IX, cir·
cellianes for circumcelliones X, episcopum for episcopi cum XIII, the
omission of loquacitate. . . collatione XVII, the omission of impium
. . . ministerium and quando . . . necessarium XXX 73 cogitandi atque
orandi for cogitanti atque oranti III, multum . . . aurariam for mulc-
tam . . . aurariam and commendatio for condemnatio XII, bibebant
ior vivebant XV, sectae for rectae XVIII, reticebantur lor recitaban-
tur XXIV, lucis for locis, evolatos fo'r evolutos, foma contabescerent
for fame contabescerent and reqionum for regiorum XXVIII, obsit for
obsit XXX 10; intellexit ior intercessit XII, heresi se ‘for recessisse
XVII, remorare for memor erat XXIII, arantibus ior videntibus

XXVII, ad locum uncti for ad loca munito XXX 2.
