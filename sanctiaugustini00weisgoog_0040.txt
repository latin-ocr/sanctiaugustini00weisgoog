INTRODUCTION Ι ³3

cursory examination of six MSS, FLMNOP. It appears to
have made hut lew alterations in the traditional printed text.
Some criticism oi the Benedictine and earlier editions is found y
in the edition by Salinas, printed at Rome in 1731, pp. V-
vlits

This edition by Salinas is the first separate edition oi the
Vita. It is based on an examination oi certain earlier editions,
chiefly the Benedictine, and MSS. BCHJ and Vatican MS.
1188θο at first hand. The edition is divided into two parts, the
first containing the text oi the Vita with critical and explana-
tory notes and the second a dissertation by Salinas De Vita et
Rebus Gestis S . Possidii. His scanty citations ol readings from
the small group oi MSS. he used, as tested by an examination
of photostatic copies, are generally accurate, but several er·
rors occur. He gives no classification or estimate of their
relative value, though he seems to have a preference lor C.
His text, on the whole, differs very little from that oi the
Benedictine edition. His choice or change oi readings, when
explained at all, is based not on manuscript evidence, but
rather on extraneous suggestions, generally oi ‘a historical
nature.

The explanatory notes in the edition oi Salinas are not
very frequent. Nevertheless they give lull and even superflu-
ous information, consisting largely oi quotations from Augus-
tine, the Acts oi Councils and other illustrations from ehurch
history. The main fault of the notes is that they are often
burdened with unnecessary matter and are not proportioned to
the importance oi the subject explained. Salinas also added .
the chapterheadings, which do not appear in the earlier edi·
tions. These have been retained in the present edition as pro-
viding convenient summaries of each chapter.
