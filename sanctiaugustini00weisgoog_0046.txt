LIFE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE
WRITTEN BY THE BISHOP POSSIDIUS

PREFACE

Inspired by God, the Maker and Ruler of all, and mindful
of my purpose wherein through the grace ol the Saviour I
resolved faithfully to serve the omnipotent and divine Trin-
ity, toth formerly as a layman and now as a bishop‚ I am
eager with whatever ability and eloquence I possess, to aid in
the edification of the holy and true Catholic Church ol Christ
the Lord, and so [have resolved] not to keep silent concern-
ing the lile and character of the most noble Bishop Augustine,
predestined long ago and presented in his own time—the
things that I have seen in him and heard from him. I have
read and observed that this very thing was often done in
times past¹ by most devout men of the holy Catholic M'other
Church. Inspired by the divine Spirit, yet using their own
speech and style, they spoke and wrote like histories for the
ears and eyes of those who wished to leam, and thus brought
to the notice ol the studious the great men who were counted
worthy by the Lord’s free grace both to live amid human af-
fairs and to persevero to the end of their course. Therefore
in that raith unfeigned whereby all righteous and faithful
souls must serve and please the Lord of Lords, I also, the
least of all His stewards, have dctennined, with the Lord's
help, to set forth the origin, 'career and end oi this venerable
man as I have learned them from him and observed them
through so many years of loving fellowship. But Ι bescech
