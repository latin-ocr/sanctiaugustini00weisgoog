CHAPTER XII

1succenturiats': “re-enforced to the full complement,” “in full force.”
Donatus, explaining succenturiatus in his commentary on the Phormio,
states its use as translatio e re militari.

²ducotoris: Α post-classical word. It is found in Angustiae:
coepit habere ducatores: Serm. CCV 2.

³mauus impios abisse: Augustino gives a similar account of this
narrow escape: Nonnullis errare profuit aliquande, sed in via pedum,
nonin oio morum. Nom nobisipsis occidit, ut in quodam bivio fallere·
mm, et non Iremus per eum locum ubi opperiens transitum nostrum
Donatistarum monus armato subsederat: atoue ita foetum est, ut eo
quo tendebamus, per devium circuitum veniremus,· cognitisque insidiis
illorum, nos gratularemur errasse, atoue inde oratioe operemus Deo:
Euchiridion xvii 5.

*domusque Deiectum: From Psalm 68:10, Jo. 2: 17.

⁸crisptms: There are many references in Augustine’s writings to
Crispinus, the Donatist bishop of Calama, including two letters directly
addressed to him. After Crispinus had refused an invitation to en·
gage fn au oral debete, Augustius, in Ep. LI, invites him to a written
discussion. Evidently this invitation was not accepted. In Ep. LXVI
he reproaches Crispinus for the forcible rebaptizing of Catholics by
the Donatists. The same subject Is taken up in Contra Litteras Petil-
iam' II lxxxiii 184 References to the trial and condemnationi of Cris·
pinus and the Donatists occur in Contra Cresconium Donatistam 111
xlvi 5ο, xlvii 51 aud Ep. LXXXVIII 7.

⁹Ecclesioe defensore: Probably Possidius, whose iailure to mention

’ his own name is in keeping with his habit throughout the Vita. Com·

pare unus er his iu the preceding sentence and the other instances in
this chapter. ·
1⁰tnfirmtsscondatum nasceretur: From 1 Cor. 8: 9, Rom. 14: 13.
¹²tertio conflictum: The first is apparently the assault oi the fol·

Crispinus that he was subject to the fine which was imposed on here-
