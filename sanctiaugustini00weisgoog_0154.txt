Augustine’s own words in which he sets forth the origin, development
and end of the Civitas Dei and the Civitas terreno: exortu et excursu
et debitis finibus: De Ciuitate Dei XI i. .

²Putrir luminum: From Jac 1:17.

ἠε de . . . putarer.- From 2 Cor. 1226.

*honorificum est: Tobiae 12:7.

monosemi: Tagaste or Thagaste was a small town in the eastern
part oi the province oi Numidia about fiity miles southeast oi Hippo·
Regius and about a hundred and fifty miles south-west oi Carthege.
Augustius names Tagaste as his birthplace: neque iu hoc inviderunt

VI iii ³) we may possibly see a reflection oi Augustine’s own busy
lile, crowded with so many secular cares that he could scarcely find
timeto study the Scriptures.

*Huius intereo verbi . . . intendebat nupenrur: Like Augustine's
verbis eius suspendebar inlustres: C owferrioner V xiii 23.
