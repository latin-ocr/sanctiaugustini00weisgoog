was persuaded by Angustiae and Alypius that he could be of greater scr·
vioe to tbe Church by repelling the barbarian hosts. Through the
treachery oi bis court rival Ainus, Placidia was turned against him
and to deiend himsell he unwisely invited the Vandals iuto Africa as
his allies. Later, when the treachery of Aietius was discovered, Boni·
iace was received back into imperial lavor and songbt to drive the
Vandals out of Airica. After an unsuccessiul battle he' was besieged
in Hippo Regius ior fourteen months. On Augustali, 430, in the
third month oi the siege, Augustine died. In July 431 the Vandals
raised the siege oi Hippo and withdraw. Then aiter another defeat in

tween Tagaste and Hippo Regius: sce Monachus, Africo Christiano
1314 Augustine mentions it in Ep. LXXXIII.

²Honorato: This letter was written in 428-429 to Honoratus, at
that time bishop oi the neighboring town oi Thiabe. This Honoratus
is not mentioned elsewhere.

the world ol Roman civilization irorn the barbarian world, rather than
to distinguish the Roman Ernpire from any other state. See Ronronio

Historia, PL 31, 840 and 1172 are apparently the earliest recorded oc·
currenees oi the word in Latin literature.

‘eversoribnsr Compare with this the use oi the word in C onfessi-
ones III iii 6, where it is applied to the bands oi smdents at Carthage
