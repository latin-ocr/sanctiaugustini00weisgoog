fixed to the V itu. .
The V ito, as already suggested, is a plain recital of 'facts
and incidents which give a clear insight into Augustine’s daily
life in public and private, based on the writer's personal and
intimate knowledge. Thm Possidius was a man of moder-

ate education appears readily. His style is
⁸⁰¹⁶ wholly unadorned. It is the work of a plain

man and untrained writer. This appears im-
mediately in the striking contrast between the style of Pos-
sidius and that of the letter of Angustiae, wonderful both in
thought and style, which he embodies in Chapter XXX. The
letter reads so smoothly and the argument is so clearly ex-

brought out by the very noticeable decrease in the variations
and difficulties which this letter presents in all the MSS. The
style of Possidius also differs radically from that of Augustine
in that it lacks vivacity, versatility and copiousness. The form
is somewhat stiff and the expression, while always marked by
candor and often by naive beauty, frequently lacks fluency.
The sentences are frequently abrupt and loosely connected.
They are bald, unrhetorical and often wanting in animation.
While his style in 'some degree resembles that of Suetonius
this is evidently due to the example of Christian biography
and not to the direct influence of Suetonius, as there appears
to be no evidence that Possidius had any acquaintance with his
writings. Possidius is both naive and commonplace in his
manner. His sentences show neither balance nor finish and
are sometimes marred by awkward parenthetical statements or
curious doubling of expression. Except in the Preface, no
serious attempt at literary finish is made. There is no philos-
ophizing or play of the imagination ; neither is there any pad-
ding or moralizing. Though the sentences are not long and
involved, yet they are frequently awkward and the thought is
not always clearly expressed. It is a simple matter-oi-fact ac-
