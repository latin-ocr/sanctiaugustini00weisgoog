LIFE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE 135

should in so lar be overcome as to pursue only the ministers
oi the Church? What shall we say? Shall the Church be
iorsaken by its ministers in ssight that it may not be lorsaken
more wretchedly by them in death? But ii the laynren are not
persecuted to the death, they can in some way or other hide
their bishops and clergy, as He shall aid, in whose control are
all things, who is able by His marvelous power to save even

sailors in the same ship. God forbid that this ship of ours
should be prized so lightly that the sailors, and especially the
pilot, ought to abandon it when it is in danger, even il they

our desertion, it is not their temporal death we tear, which
is sure to come at some time, but their eternal death which
can corne it we are not carelul and which cannot come if we
are carcful. But in the common perils ol this life, why should
we believe that wherever there is a hostile invasion all the
clergy, and not all the laymen also, are going to perish so that
those ior whom the clergy are necessary shall all end this lile
together? Or why should we not expect that as some of the
laymen shall survive, so also shall some of the clergy, by whom
the necessary ministry may be provided ior them?

were as to which of them should remain that the Church be
not abandoned by the flight of all, and which ol thern should
flee that it be not abandoned by the death of alll Such, in·
deed, will be the rivalry among them when both a're kindled
